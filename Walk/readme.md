### Description

This Java program simulates a walking game where two players, "Ali" and "Hasan", navigate through a grid while avoiding predetermined hurdles. "Ali" is a controlled player who moves based on user input, while "Hasan" moves randomly. The goal is to see how far each player can travel from the starting position without hitting a hurdle.

### Features

1. **Player Control**:
    - "Ali" is controlled by the user through input commands to move up, down, left, or right.
    - "Hasan" moves randomly in one of four directions.

2. **Hurdle Detection**:
    - The grid contains preset hurdle coordinates.
    - Players cannot move to a position if it coincides with a hurdle.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
    - The program calculates and displays the distance of each player from the starting position after a set number of steps.

4. **Interactive Gameplay**:
    - The game prompts the user to input the number of steps and control "Ali"'s movement in each step.
    - Displays the current position of both players after each move.

5. **Feedback System**:
    - Provides feedback on each move, indicating if a hurdle is encountered and preventing the player from moving to that position.
    - Displays the current coordinates of each player after each move.
