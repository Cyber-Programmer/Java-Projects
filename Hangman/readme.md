# Description
This Java program implements a console-based Hangman game with three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. Players can select their desired difficulty level, and a random word from the corresponding word list is chosen for the game. The player then attempts to guess the word by inputting letters, with a limited number of guesses and warnings. Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word, while incorrect guesses decrease the available attempts. The game provides feedback on the available letters, the current state of the word, and the number of remaining guesses. Scores are calculated based on the difficulty level, number of guesses, and remaining attempts. Players can continue to play additional rounds, with their total score accumulating until they choose to end the game.
