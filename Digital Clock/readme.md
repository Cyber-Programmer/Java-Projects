This Java program simulates a digital timer. 

### Features

1. **Digital Timer**: It displays time in hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format.

2. **User Input**: Users can input the desired duration for the timer to run and the initial time settings.

3. **Counting Logic**: The timer increments seconds, minutes, and hours while properly resetting each counter when it reaches its limit.

4. **AM/PM Indicator**: The program alternates between AM and PM when the hour counter exceeds 12.

5. **Display Formatting**: Time values are displayed with leading zeros to ensure a consistent format.

6. **Real-time Update**: The timer updates every half-second to simulate real-time behavior.

### Functionality

- **Initialization**: Users input the initial time settings (hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM) and the duration for the timer to run.

- **Counting**: The timer counts seconds, minutes, and hours based on the user-defined initial time settings and the specified duration.

- **AM/PM Handling**: The program properly toggles between AM and PM when the hour counter exceeds 12.

- **Display**: Time values are displayed in the format `HH:MM:SS AM/PM` with leading zeros where necessary.

### Applications

- **Education**: Useful for learning about timekeeping, counters, and simulation in programming.

- **Simulation**: Can be used in applications where a digital timer is needed for scheduling or time-based operations.

- **Training**: Helpful for teaching programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.
